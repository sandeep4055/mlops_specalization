# Overview Of Machine learning in Production
### Traditional ML : 
*Traditional ML* focuses on developing and training machine learning models.

### Production ML
*Production ML* involves deploying and managing models in real-world production environments to deliver ongoing value and performance.

### Production Ml vs Traditional Ml

#### So in brief production Ml is Machine learning Development + Modern Software development

#### So the Production Ml requires all these 4 steps
- **Scoping**
- **Data**
- **Modelling**
- **Deployment**
